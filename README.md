# HandwritingRecognition for whole-page documents

OCR for handwritten documents

Part I Text segmentation

in the unsupervised_line_segmentation folder:
  - It is a solution previously proposed in the paper: https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~berat/papers/icpr2020_unsupervised_deep_learning_for_text_line_segmentation.pdf
  - full pipeline for preparing dataset and training the net. 
  - # Unfortunately, this approach does not work for now (network is not improving on accuracy, which is around 50%)

There will be another two folders uploaded:
- text segmentation using: https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~berat/papers/mdpi2020Learningfree.pdf (matlab ran from python)
- text recognition based on CNN + RNN + CTC, based on https://github.com/githubharald/SimpleHTR and http://www.tbluche.com/files/icdar17_gnn.pdf
